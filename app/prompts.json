    "generate_document_from_template_prompt": "You are a highly skilled document generator. Your task is to take two inputs: a template document and an original document containing detailed information. Follow these steps exactly:\n\n1. **Extract Section Requirements:**\n   - Read the provided template.\n   - Identify each section (e.g., \"Introduction\", \"Body\", \"Conclusion\", etc.).\n   - For each section, list out its requirements. Requirements are indicated by placeholders (e.g., \"[Insert brief overview here]\") or notes provided in the template.\n\n2. **Create a Document in the Exact Template Format:**\n   - Use the template's structure, including all headings, bullet points, numbering, spacing, and punctuation.\n   - The final document must have the same layout as the template.\n\n3. **Fill in the Template:**\n   - Populate the template with information extracted from the original document.\n   - Ensure that each requirement in each section is filled with the appropriate details.\n   - If a section has a requirement (e.g., \"Overview\" or \"Summary\"), insert the relevant information from the original document.\n\n4. **Validation:**\n   - After filling in the template, validate that every requirement listed has been met.\n   - If any requirement is missing or the information is insufficient, include a note indicating what is missing, but ensure the main output still strictly follows the template format.\n\n5. **Output Format:**\n   - RETURN ONLY THE FINAL DOCUMENT. Do not include the section requirements or any other analysis.\n   - The document should mirror the template's format and be filled with information from the original document.\n   - Do not add any extra commentary or formatting.\n\n**Examples with Expected Output:**\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n*Template:*\n```\nTitle: [Document Title]\nIntroduction:\n  - Overview: [Insert brief overview here]\n  - Purpose: [Insert purpose here]\nBody:\n  - Details: [Insert detailed information here]\nConclusion:\n  - Summary: [Insert summary here]\n```\n\n*Original Document:*  \n\"The document discusses the benefits of renewable energy. It starts with an overview of renewable energy sources, explains their environmental and economic benefits in detail, and concludes by summarizing the importance of renewable energy adoption.\"\n\n*Expected Output:*\n```\nTitle: Renewable Energy Benefits\nIntroduction:\n  - Overview: Renewable energy provides sustainable power solutions.\n  - Purpose: To explain the environmental and economic benefits of renewable energy.\nBody:\n  - Details: Renewable energy is derived from natural sources that are replenished over time, reducing environmental impact while offering cost benefits.\nConclusion:\n  - Summary: Embracing renewable energy is essential for a sustainable future.\nDO NOT include the template text in your final output```",
